# React Vite with TypeScript - Learning Path

## Introduction
This repository is a step-by-step guide for getting started with React, Vite, and TypeScript. The content is based on key lessons and concepts learned from React, focusing on building dynamic and interactive user interfaces using best practices. It covers fundamental React concepts such as components, JSX, hooks, state management, forms, and connecting to a backend, all while utilizing Vite for project scaffolding and TypeScript for type safety.

## Getting Started with React

### Overview
- React is a **JavaScript library** designed for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- React applications are built using **components** – small, reusable pieces of UI.
- JSX (JavaScript XML) is used to define the UI in a format that combines HTML and JavaScript.
- React optimizes performance using the **virtual DOM**, which updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM when the state changes.

### Key Concepts
- **Components**: React components can be class-based or function-based (preferred).
- **JSX**: A syntax extension that combines HTML and JavaScript into a readable format.
- **Virtual DOM**: An in-memory representation of the real DOM used for efficient UI updates.

## Building Components

### Overview
- React components can return only one element. To return multiple elements, you can use a **fragment** (`<>` `</>`).
- Rendering lists is done using the `array.map()` method, with each element requiring a unique **key**.
- **Conditional Rendering** can be handled using `if` statements or ternary operators.
- Components can accept inputs using **props**, which should be treated as immutable.

### Key Concepts
- **State Hook**: Adds state to function components. React re-renders components when state or props change.
- **Props**: Used to pass data and functions to child components. Props are read-only.

## Managing Component State

### Overview
- React provides a **state hook** for managing data that can change over time in function components.
- State updates in React are asynchronous, meaning they’re batched and applied after event handlers complete.
- React follows the principle of immutability, which means you should never directly modify state. Instead, always create new objects or arrays when updating the state.

### Key Concepts
- **Lifting State Up**: To share state between components, lift the state to the closest common parent.
- **Pure Components**: Always return the same JSX for the same inputs. Avoid side effects during rendering.
- **Strict Mode**: Helps catch issues like impure components by rendering components twice in development mode.

## Building Forms

### Overview
- Forms are essential in user interaction, and handling them correctly in React is key.
- You can use either the **ref hook** or the **state hook** to manage form inputs and state. React Hook Form is a popular library that simplifies form handling.
- **Validation**: Forms can be validated using HTML5 attributes or schema-based validation libraries like **Zod**.

### Key Concepts
- **React Hook Form**: A library for building forms quickly with less code.
- **Schema Validation**: Tools like Zod can help define validation rules in a single place using schemas.

## Connecting to the Backend

### Overview
- React is a front-end library, and to create full-fledged applications, you need to communicate with a backend.
- Communication with a backend server happens through **HTTP**. React handles side effects like HTTP requests using the **effect hook**.

### Key Concepts
- **Axios**: A popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests in React.
- **Effect Hook**: Allows you to perform side effects like fetching data from a backend.
- **Custom Hooks**: Used to extract reusable logic, such as making HTTP requests, to share across components.
